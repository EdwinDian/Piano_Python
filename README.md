# Requirements
Complete assignment in 2 different programming languages of your choice.  
Provide a github link to 2 project upon completion

# Assignment
The client has provided 2 csv files with user data that they would like to import to the system:
### File A:
user_id,email  
oi6IhEzu9R,user_2@example.com\
fQFLNRDae8,user_5@example.com\
fBYRtPtAlC,user_7@example.com\
fOSjdLnNP3,user_9@example.com\
uxz2jFwr5I,user_1@example.com\
zSbmdNiSHH,user_4@example.com\
fjM66woroy,user_0@example.com\
oh4mHXh8zN,user_3@example.com\
gXWj37JC5d,user_8@example.com\
4dBdXURAz3,user_6@example.com

### File B:
user_id,first_name,last_name\
oh4mHXh8zN,Julie,Mosser\
zSbmdNiSHH,Taryn,Jaycox\
fBYRtPtAlC,John,Smith\
fjM66woroy,Yadira,Irving\
fQFLNRDae8,Vella,Lynam\
fOSjdLnNP3,Qiana,Walk\
uxz2jFwr5I,Benito,Festa\
oi6IhEzu9R,Leatrice,Oquinn\
4dBdXURAz3,Jacques,Cuellar\
gXWj37JC5d,Shaun,Kreiger

However some user IDs are incorrect, because these users already exist in the system under different user_id value. Generate a merged file in the format:  
user_id,email,first_name,last_name  
But make sure that for the incorrect records, user_id is taken from the system, rather than from the list provided from the client.

## Materials
API documentation - https://docs.piano.io/api  
Domain for API requests - sandbox.tinypass.com  
AID (Application ID) - o1sRRZSLlw  
API Token - zziNT81wShznajW2BD5eLA4VCkmNJ88Guye7Sw4D

# Conclusion
I've used Python to allow the user to validate a merged version of the clients data.  The program will create an updated version of the CSV,
using the IDs from the Piano DB.  The new CSV will be saved into the "data" folder that's inline with the Python script.

### Further enhancements/obsticles:
-  Clearer instructions to the user once the export is done.
-  on-screen update of the rows that were changed.
-  Further enhance the UX.
